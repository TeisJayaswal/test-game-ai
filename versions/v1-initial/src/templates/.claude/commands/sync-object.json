Add RealtimeTransform for position/rotation sync\n4. Ask if I need custom property sync (e.g., color, health, state)\n5. If yes, create a custom RealtimeComponent<T> for the properties\n6. Explain the ownership model and how changes will sync\n\nFollow Normcore's synchronization patterns and best practices."
